# SelfKey UI Library

This module contains common UI components for the SelfKey family of applications written in Typescript.

It uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for development, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for dependency management and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing.

Components hot-reload during development and stories are automatically loaded from the `stories` directory from any files with the `.stories.tsx` extension.

## Setup

```bash
yarn
yarn install -g @storybook/cli
yarn start
```
